# CS312-FinalProject

Final Group Project for CS312 (Analysis of Algorithms Course)

## Project Description

Part 1 of this project begins with an introduction to the graph data structure utilizing various functionalities such as adding vertices, adding edges, checking for vertex existence, and retrieving neighbors. It also includes an example client program to demonstrate the usage of the graph class.

## Features

- Add vertices to the graph
- Add edges between vertices
- Check if a vertex exists in the graph
- Retrieve the neighbors of a vertex
- Print the graph's contents
